# GdCo_Nanodots_Magnetic-Simulations
Simulations &amp; scripts I wrote utilizing JOOMMF to study the magnetic behavior of GdCo magnetic nanodots. The simulations were part of an experimental study to examine ultrafast all-optical switching in nanometer-size magnetic dots. The results of our research project was published in the scientific journal, <em>Applied Physics Letters</em>, and can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5098453).

These simulations were done utilizing [JOOMMF](https://joommf.github.io/). JOOMMF is a Python interface to OOMMF (Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework), and allows the running and analyses of micromagnetic simulations to be done in Jupyter notebooks.
