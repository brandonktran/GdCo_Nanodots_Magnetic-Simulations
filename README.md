# GdCo_Nanodots_Magnetic-Simulations
Simulations &amp; scripts I wrote using the object oriented micromagnetic framework (OOMF) and Python to study the magnetic behavior of GdCo magnetic nanodots. The simulations were part of a larger experimental study to examine ultrafast all-optical switching in nanometer-size magnetic dots. The results of this research project was published in the scientific journal, <em>Applied Physics Letters<em>, and can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5098453}{DOI: 10.1063/1.5098453)
