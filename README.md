# GdCo_Nanodots_Magnetic-Simulations
Simulations &amp; scripts I wrote using the object oriented micromagnetic framework (OOMF) and Python to study the magnetic behavior of GdCo magnetic nanodots. The simulations were part of an experimental study to examine ultrafast all-optical switching in nanometer-size magnetic dots. The results of our research project was published in the scientific journal, <em>Applied Physics Letters</em>, and can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5098453)
